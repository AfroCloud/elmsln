ELMSLN - Installation Guide

These steps will help you setup ELMSLN on an Apache / Unix environment.

Using git for version control is recommended due to the sheer volume of files Suggested .gitignores are included but generally all changes you make after deploying should happen inside the config directory.  All scripts, Drupal core files, and piwik files that need configuration changes are referenced to symlinks in the config directory.

=== DOWNLOAD ===
First, get elmsln and put it in /var/www:

cd /var/www
sudo mkdir elmsln
sudo chown {you}:{group} elmsln
git clone https://github.com/btopro/elmsln.git

Next you’ll want to replace the included config directory with an example one.
cd /var/www/elmsln
rm -rf config
git clone https://github.com/btopro/elmsln-config-example.git config

=== MODIFY CONFIG ===
cd /var/www/elmsln/config/scripts/drush-create-site/
cp config.cfg.example config.cfg
vi config.cfg

Modify these values to match your file system and implementation requirements. More often then not this is simply supplying default email addresses and mysql root user / pass.  There are additional options based on your configuration changes but those entered are recommended defaults.

=== SELINUX (recommended) ===
Next you need to modify selinux settings
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_network connect
sudo setsebool -P httpd_can_sendmail
chcon -R --reference /var/www/html /dev/shm

=== APC ===
Apply the settings recommended in docs/apc.txt:
sudo vi /etc/php.d/apc.ini (/etc/php5/conf.d/apc.ini for ubuntu)

=== PHP ===
Apply the settings recommended in docs/php.txt
sudo vi /etc/php.ini (/etc/php5/apache2/php.ini for ubuntu)

=== MYSQL ===
Apply the settings recommended in docs/mysql.txt
sudo vi /etc/my.cnf (/etc/php5/conf.d/mysql.ini for ubuntu)

=== BIN ===
issue the following commands to place these scripts in scope of bin which will allow the crontab to pick up the job and process it.  There’s also an optional drush remove site command that’s listed too. (good for clean up of things accidentally created)

sudo ln -s /var/www/elmsln/scripts/drush-create-site /usr/local/bin/drush-create-site
chmod 744 /usr/local/bin/drush-create-site/rm-site.sh

# add the following command for drush remove site shorthand
sudo -i
vi .bashrc
alias drs='/usr/local/bin/drush-create-site/rm-site.sh'
logout

=== CRONTAB ===
Apply the settings recommended in docs/crontab.txt
sudo vi /etc/crontab

=== DOMAINS ===
Apply similar settings to those recommended in docs/domains.txt
sudo vi /etc/httpd/conf.d/domains.conf (/etc/apache2/sites-available/elmsln for ubuntu then symlink into sites-enabled)

=== DRUSH ===
Install drush by following instructions at https://github.com/drush-ops/drush
sudo pear upgrade --force Console_Getopt
sudo pear upgrade --force pear
sudo pear upgrade-all
sudo pear channel-discover pear.drush.org
sudo pear install drush/drush

# copy the included drush packages (for root and you)
sudo cp -r /var/www/elmsln/scripts/drush/server/* ~/.drush/
sudo chown -R {user}:{user} .drush
vi ~/.drush/elmsln.aliases.drushrc.php
# change the domain to your base domain and change the grouping to your config grouping identifier
sudo -i
cp -r /var/www/elmsln/scripts/drush/server/* ~/.drush/
vi ~/.drush/elmsln.aliases.drushrc.php
# change the domain to your base domain and change the grouping to your config grouping identifier
logout

=== MBSTRING ===
install mb_string package

sudo apt-get install yum
yum repolist
subscription-manager repos --enable rhel-6-server-optional-rpms
yum repolist
yum update
yum install php-mbstring
touch /etc/php.d/mbstring.ini
vi  /etc/php.d/mbstring.ini

(add the following to that file)
extension=mbstring.so

=== RESTART APACHE ===
sudo apachectl -k restart

=== ELMSLN INSTALLER ===
The last step is to invoke the elmsln-install.sh script to kick everything off.
This will automatically take your default settings defined in 
elmsln/config/scripts/drush-create-site/config.cfg and try and install all the
 drupal sites needed to get things started.It will also automatically author a 
 module with all of your private connection credentials using a randomly 
 generated cis_connector keychain.

You can find this module in elmsln/config/shared/drupal-7.x/modules and can 
modify it as you see fit but it’s a great starting point for all of the web 
service calls to work correctly between systems OOTB.  It’s also automatically 
enabled on all the jobs kicked off by the script so everything can talk to 
each other.

the command is:
sudo bash /var/www/elmsln/scripts/install/elmsln-install.sh

At this point, ELMSLN should pick up files and start trying to build them and 
hopefully you’ll get emails if it all worked!  The first site you want to go
 to is your online address and login with admin/admin.  After making other
  sites you can run a command like this to recover it:

drush @online upwd {username from config} —password=“{new password}”

=== EASE OF DEV (optional) ===
symlink to elmsln
ln -s /var/www/elmsln elmsln

shorter commands for lazy people
vi .bashrc
alias g='git'
alias d='drush'
alias l='ls -laHD'

=== PIWIK (optional) ===
Install the analytics package by pointing a domain to the 
elmsln/domains/analytics.  This is running piwik and has config and tmp files 
modified to point to the symlink directories in the config directory.

Stay thirsty my friends.
